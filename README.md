# 🤖  Automate with AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Splunk Enterprise, Shell Scripting

**Automating, versioning, and provision Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Infrastructure As Code (IaC)**

## 🛠️  What is the Purpose of  Project?

In the world of DevOps, Infrastructure as Code (Iac) is keep in terms of automating the provision of infrastructure on cloud platforms ☁️  such AWS, Azure, GCP, and among others. 
For example in this project, Terraform is used as the IaC tool to create eight (8) resources on AWS. [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), a popular open-source Configuration as Code (CaC)
is employed to deploy, configure, and manage [Splunk Enterprise](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk) instances in the provisioned AWS EC2 instances using a Bash Shell Script.

- **AWS EC2:** A scalable, secure virtual servers provided by AWS.
- **AWS Internet Gateway**
